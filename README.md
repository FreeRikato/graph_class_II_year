# Graph class

This repository contains resources for the graph class. I have provided the website urls that i have used for demonstrating graph traversals:

- Maze path finder - https://mazepathfinder.netlify.app/
- HackerEarth dfs/bfs visualization - https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/depth-first-search/visualize/
- Visualgo dfs/bfs visualization - https://visualgo.net/en/dfsbfs

Problems to solve:
- BFS Traversal - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/bfs-traversal-of-graph/1
- DFS Traversal - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/1
- Number of Provinces - https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/
